                    We study the corporate-loan pricing decisions of a major Greek bank during the
                    Greek financial crisis. A unique aspect of our dataset is that we observe both the interest rate and
                    the "breakeven rate" of each loan, as computed by the bank's own loan-pricing department (in
                    effect,
                    the loan's marginal cost). We document that low-breakeven-rate (safer) borrowers are charged
                    significant markups, whereas high-breakeven-rate (riskier) borrowers are charged small and sometimes
                    even negative markups. We rationalize this de-facto cross-subsidization of riskier borrowers by
                    safer
                    borrowers through the lens of a dynamic model featuring depressed collateral values, impaired
                    capital-market access, and limit pricing.

                    Judicial decisions in bankruptcy are often influenced by the goal of preserving
                    employment. Using the text of judicial decisions and the random assignment of cases across courts in
                    the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil, we construct a novel court-level measure of pro-labor bias and
                    study
                    its effect on labor market outcomes. Employees of distressed firms assigned to high pro-labor courts
                    are more likely to stay with their employer; however, they experience a 4.5% decline in earnings.
                    This
                    effect is driven by wage adjustments, it is stronger for workers with better outside options, and
                    concentrated in periods of economic expansion.

                    Does partisan perception shape the flow of international capital? We provide
                    evidence from two settings, syndicated corporate loans and equity mutual funds, to show that
                    ideological alignment with foreign governments affects the cross-border capital allocation by U.S.
                    institutional investors. Moreover, we find that ideological alignment with foreign countries also
                    affects investments of non-U.S. investors and can explain patterns in bilateral FDI flows. Our
                    empirical strategy ensures that direct economic effects of foreign elections or bilateral ties
                    between

                    Partisan perception affects the actions of professionals in the financial sector.
                    Using a novel dataset linking credit rating analysts to party affiliations from voter records, we
                    show
                    that analysts who are not affiliated with the U.S. president's party downward-adjust corporate
                    credit
                    ratings more frequently. By comparing analysts with different party affiliations covering the same
                    firm
                    in the same quarter, we ensure that differences in firm fundamentals cannot explain the results. We
                    also
                    find a sharp divergence in the rating actions of Democratic and Republican analysts around the 2016
                    presidential election. Our results suggest partisan perception has implications for firms' cost of

                  We study how the disclosure of corrupt practices affects firms and their employees. We
                  construct novel firm-level measures of involvement in corrupt practices using randomized audits and
                  public
                  procurement suspensions in Brazil. On average, exposed firms grow larger after the audits. However,
                  this
                  result masks large heterogeneity depending on the degree of firm involvement in the corruption scheme.
                  Using contract-, loan-, and worker- level data, we show that highly corrupt firms suffer after
                  anti-corruption initiatives, while other exposed firms grow by changing their investment strategy when
                  shifting away from doing business with the government.

                    We examine the effect of pay transparency on gender pay gap and firm outcomes. This
                    paper exploits a 2006 legislation change in Denmark that requires firms to provide gender
                    dis-aggregated wage statistics. Using detailed employee-employer administrative data and a
                    difference-in-differences approach, we find that the law reduces the gender pay gap, primarily by
                    slowing the wage growth for male employees. The gender pay gap declines by approximately two
                    percentage points, or a 7% reduction relative to the pre-legislation mean. In addition, the wage
                    transparency mandate causes a reduction in firm productivity and in the overall wage bill, leaving
                    firm profitability unchanged.

                      This article reviews the existing literature about management practices in family
                      firms, the most prevalent form of corporate ownership around the world. I summarize the existing

                      especially "dynastic" family firms that combine family ownership and control. I discuss what might
                      be the unique features of family firms that drive the lower adoption of management practices,
                      despite the evidence that improving management boosts their productivity and performance.

                      We use detailed information on individual absent spells of all employees in 4,140
                      firms in Denmark to document large differences in average absenteeism across firms. Using
                      employees
                      who switch firms, we decompose days absent into an individual component (e.g., motivation, work
                      ethic)
                      and a firm component (e.g., incentives, corporate culture). We find the firm component explains
                      50%
                      to 60% of the difference in absenteeism across firms, with the individual component explaining the
                      rest. We present suggestive evidence of the mechanisms behind the firm effect with family firm
                      status
                      and concentrated ownership strongly correlated with decreases in absenteeism. We also analyze the
                      firm characteristics that correlate with the individual effect and find that firms with stronger
                      career incentives attract lower-absenteeism employees.

                      sensitivity. Three tests support a causal interpretation of the results. First, when we require
                      directors
                      to have a minimum tenure of three years, there is no material change in the results, suggesting
                      that
                      the timing of when directors join their boards is unlikely to drive the results. Second, we find
                      similar results when we use director Closeness-to-election on other boards as a measure of
                      proximity
                      to elections. Third, when we restrict the analysis to firms with unitary boards, there is no
                      material
                      change in the results, suggesting that director self-selection into firms with staggered boards
                      does
                      not drive the results. Cross-sectional tests suggest that, when other governance mechanisms are in
                      place, CEO turnover‚Äìperformance sensitivity is affected to a lesser extent by
                      Closeness-to-election.
                      We conclude that director elections have important implications for corporate governance.

                      We show that in semiformal economies, banks lend to tax-evading individuals based
                      on the bank's perception of the individual's true income. This observation leads to a novel
                      approach
                      to estimate tax evasion using the adaptation of the private sector to the norms of semiformality.
                      We use bank microdata on household credit, and replicate the bank model of credit capacity
                      decision
                      to infer the bank‚Äôs estimate of individuals‚Äô true income. We estimate a lower bound of 28.2
                      billion
                      euros of unreported income for Greece. The foregone government revenues amount to 32% of the
                      deficit
                      for 2009. Primary tax-evading industries are medicine, law, engineering, education, and media. We
                      provide evidence that tax evasion persists not because the tax authorities are unaware, but
                      because
                      of a lack of paper trail and political willpower. Finally, we speak to the reproducibility and
                      applicability
                      of our method in other semiformal settings.

                      This paper provides causal evidence on the impact of succession taxes on firm
                      investment
                      decisions and transfer of control. I exploit a 2002 policy change in Greece that substantially
                      reduced
                      the tax on intra-family transfers of businesses and show that succession taxes lead to more than
                      a 40% decline in investment around family successions, slow sales growth, and depletion of cash
                      reserves.
                      Furthermore, succession taxes strongly affect the decision to sell or retain the firm within the
                      family. I conclude by discussing implications of my findings for firms in the United States and
                      Europe.

                      This paper shows that proxy contests have a significant adverse effect on careers
                      of incumbent directors. Following a proxy contest, directors experience a significant decline in
                      number of directorships not only in the targeted company, but also in other non-targeted
                      companies.
                      The results are established using the universe of all proxy contests during 1996-2010. To
                      establish
                      that this effect of proxy contests is causal, we use within-firm variation in directors' exposure
                      to proxy contests and exploit the predetermined schedule of staggered boards that only allows a
                      fraction
                      of directors to be nominated for election every year. We find that nominated directors relative to
                      non-nominated ones lose 45% more seats on other boards. We discuss that this pattern can be
                      expected
                      if proxy contest mechanism imposes a significant career cost on incumbent directors.

                      Executive teams in U.S. firms are becoming increasingly politically polarized. We
                      establish this new fact using political affiliations from voter registration records for top
                      executives of S&P 1500 firms between 2008 and 2018. The rise in political homogeneity is explained
                      by both a rising share of Republican executives and increased sorting by partisan executives into
                      firms with like-minded individuals. We further document substantial heterogeneity across party

                      We examine the sources and evolution of the gender pay gap in finance, using
                      administrative micro data from the U.K. for 1997-2019. We show a persistently larger gender pay
                      gap
                      in finance, compared to other sectors. Exploiting employees who switch firms, we find the gender
                      pay
                      gap in finance is predominantly explained by more skilled male employees sorting into finance
                      relative to other sectors. The gender pay gap in finance is relatively lower for flexible
                      occupations, in firms that offer childcare benefits and in more female friendly environments. Over
                      time, higher investment in human capital for women and sorting in high-skilled occupations within
                      the sector as well as policy interventions have reduced the gender pay gap in finance.

                        Platform intermediation of goods and services has considerably transformed the
                        U.S. economy. Using confidential, administrative data on U.S. tax returns for the universe of
                        firms and individuals, we study the effect of the platform economy on entrepreneurship. We find
                        that flexible labor availability increases the entry of individuals into entrepreneurship. Using
                        detailed information on individual-level income, we show that income derived from platforms
                        facilitate new firm creation. We also compare firms started by entrepreneurs with platform-based
                        income with similar firms founded in the same area and at the same time. We find that
                        gig-founded
                        firms are more likely to survive, have more employees, and be profitable. Taken together, these

                        We develop a new approach to identify different categories of depositors during
                        periods of uncertainty and quantify their compensation to remain in the bank. We isolate
                        withdrawals due to liquidity needs, deterioration of fundamentals, and expectation about
                        withdrawal behavior
                        of other depositors. We exploit variation in the cost of withdrawal induced by the maturity
                        expiration of time deposits around unexpected uncertainty events and high-frequency microdata
                        from
                        a large Greek bank. Deposit withdrawals quadrupled in response to a policy uncertainty shock
                        that
                        doubled the short-run credit default swap (CDS) price of Greek sovereign bonds. About two-thirds
                        of this increase is driven by direct exposure to deteriorating fundamentals, and
                        the remainder due to strategic complementarities. We find that depositors need to be offered
                        annualized returns exceeding 50% to remain in the bank during episodes of high uncertainty. Our
                        findings provide new insights into the design of interventions that prevent runs by targeting
                        depositors with the largest propensity to withdraw.

                        We study the effects of deploying government capital to firms during crises.
                        Using exogenous variation in the timing of disbursements in the Paycheck Protection Program
                        (PPP),

                        in credit supply. These effects are amplified for firms with heightened financial constraints.

                        also show that firms receiving loans later have lower economic activity using in-store activity

                        The purpose of the paper is to examine the effect of founding family control on
                        the
                        cost of bank debt. We examine the cost of accessing the syndicated market and we use the
                        financial
                        crisis and the unexpected nature of Lehman Brother's collapse as a laboratory in order to tease
                        out
                        the effect of family ownership. We find that the increase in loan spreads around the Lehman
                        crisis
                        was by at least 24 basis points lower for family firms. Furthermore, the gap in spreads among
                        family
                        and non-family firms becomes wider among firms that had pre-crisis relationships with lenders
                        with
                        higher exposure to the shock. The evidence are consistent with family ownership lowering the
                        cost
                        of accessing debt financing especially when lenders are constrained. We further investigate
                        potential
                        channels that drive the effect of family ownership. We provide novel evidence that for 17% of
                        the
                        family firms creditors impose explicit restrictions in private credit agreements that require
                        the
                        founding family to maintain a minimum percentage of ownership or voting power. Thus creditors
                        value
                        the presence of the family. Furthermore, the impact of family control on lowering the cost of
                        bank
                        debt is higher when family CEOs run the firms and among firms with higher ex ante agency
                        conflicts.
