                      <em>Abstract: </em>Partisan perception affects the actions of professionals in the financial sector. Using a novel dataset linking credit rating analysts to party affiliations from voter records, we show that analysts who are not affiliated with the U.S. president's party downward-adjust corporate credit ratings more frequently. By comparing analysts with different party affiliations covering  the same firm in the same quarter, we ensure that differences in firm fundamentals cannot explain the results. We also find a sharp divergence in the rating actions of Democratic and Republican analysts around the 2016 presidential election. Our results suggest partisan perception has implications for firms' cost of capital. </p>

                                <em>Abstract: </em>We examine the effect of pay transparency on gender pay gap and firm outcomes. This paper exploits a 2006 legislation change in Denmark that requires firms to provide gender dis-aggregated wage statistics. Using detailed employee-employer administrative data and a difference-in-differences approach, we find that the law reduces the gender pay gap, primarily by slowing the wage growth for male employees. The gender pay gap declines by approximately two percentage points, or a 7% reduction relative to the pre-legislation mean. In addition, the wage transparency mandate causes a reduction in firm productivity and in the overall wage bill, leaving firm profitability unchanged.                             </p>

                                <em>Abstract: </em>We use detailed information on individual absent spells of all employees in 4,140
                                firms in Denmark to document large differences in average absenteeism across firms. Using employees
                                who switch firms, we decompose days absent into an individual component (e.g., motivation, work ethic)
                                and a firm component (e.g., incentives, corporate culture). We find the firm component explains 50%
                                to 60% of the difference in absenteeism across firms, with the individual component explaining the
                                rest. We present suggestive evidence of the mechanisms behind the firm effect with family firm status
                                and concentrated ownership strongly correlated with decreases in absenteeism. We also analyze the
                                firm characteristics that correlate with the individual effect and find that firms with stronger
                                career incentives attract lower-absenteeism employees.</p>

                                <em>Abstract:</em> Using a hand-collected sample of more than 30,000 directors nominated for election
                                over the period 2001–2010, we construct a novel measure of director proximity to elections— Closeness-to-election.
                                We find that the closer a director is to her next election, the higher is CEO turnover–performance
                                sensitivity. Each year closer to director elections is associated with a 23% increase in CEO turnover–performance
                                sensitivity. Three tests support a causal interpretation of the results. First, when we require directors
                                to have a minimum tenure of three years, there is no material change in the results, suggesting that
                                the timing of when directors join their boards is unlikely to drive the results. Second, we find
                                similar results when we use director Closeness-to-election on other boards as a measure of proximity
                                to elections. Third, when we restrict the analysis to firms with unitary boards, there is no material
                                change in the results, suggesting that director self-selection into firms with staggered boards does
                                not drive the results. Cross-sectional tests suggest that, when other governance mechanisms are in
                                place, CEO turnover–performance sensitivity is affected to a lesser extent by Closeness-to-election.
                                We conclude that director elections have important implications for corporate governance.

                                <em>Abstract: </em>We show that in semiformal economies, banks lend to tax-evading individuals based
                                on the bank's perception of the individual's true income. This observation leads to a novel approach
                                to estimate tax evasion using the adaptation of the private sector to the norms of semiformality.
                                We use bank microdata on household credit, and replicate the bank model of credit capacity decision
                                to infer the bank’s estimate of individuals’ true income. We estimate a lower bound of 28.2 billion
                                euros of unreported income for Greece. The foregone government revenues amount to 32% of the deficit
                                for 2009. Primary tax-evading industries are medicine, law, engineering, education, and media. We
                                provide evidence that tax evasion persists not because the tax authorities are unaware, but because
                                of a lack of paper trail and political willpower. Finally, we speak to the reproducibility and applicability
                                of our method in other semiformal settings.

                                decisions and transfer of control. I exploit a 2002 policy change in Greece that substantially reduced
                                the tax on intra-family transfers of businesses and show that succession taxes lead to more than
                                a 40% decline in investment around family successions, slow sales growth, and depletion of cash reserves.
                                Furthermore, succession taxes strongly affect the decision to sell or retain the firm within the
                                family. I conclude by discussing implications of my findings for firms in the United States and Europe.

                                <em>Abstract: </em>This paper shows that proxy contests have a significant adverse effect on careers
                                of incumbent directors. Following a proxy contest, directors experience a significant decline in
                                number of directorships not only in the targeted company, but also in other non-targeted companies.
                                The results are established using the universe of all proxy contests during 1996-2010. To establish
                                that this effect of proxy contests is causal, we use within-firm variation in directors' exposure
                                to proxy contests and exploit the predetermined schedule of staggered boards that only allows a fraction
                                of directors to be nominated for election every year. We find that nominated directors relative to
                                non-nominated ones lose 45% more seats on other boards. We discuss that this pattern can be expected
                                if proxy contest mechanism imposes a significant career cost on incumbent directors.

We establish this new fact using political affiliations from voter registration records for top executives of S&P 1500 firms between 2008 and 2018. The rise in political homogeneity is explained by both a rising share of Republican executives and increased sorting by partisan executives into firms with like-minded individuals. We further document substantial heterogeneity across party lines in executives’ beliefs, as proxied by their trading of company stock around presidential elections, as well as in firms’ investment decisions.

What are the effects of these pro-labor decisions on workers’ earnings and employment trajectories? We construct a new court-level measure of pro-labor bias based on the text of judicial decisions and exploit the random assignment of cases to courts within judicial districts in the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil to study the effect of pro-labor bias on labor market outcomes. We find that workers of firms assigned to high-pro-labor courts experience 4.4% lower post-bankruptcy earnings. This negative effect is primarily driven by wage adjustment rather than the probability of employment, and it is persistent in the five-year period after bankruptcy. We discuss several mechanisms that can drive this result.

                              <em>Abstract: </em>This paper develops a new approach to identify and quantify different rationales for deposit withdrawals.
                              Exploiting variation in the cost of withdrawal induced by the
                              maturity expiration of time-deposits, the approach can distinguish between withdrawals
                              due to liquidity needs, exposure to fundamental uncertainty, or expectations about how
                              other depositors will behave. Using daily micro-data from a large Greek bank we show
                              that early deposit withdrawal probability quadruples in response to a policy uncertainty
                              shock that doubled the short-run CDS price of Greek sovereign bonds. About two-thirds
                              of this increase is driven by direct exposure to policy uncertainty with the remainder
                              due to changes in expectations of behavior of other depositors. We estimate depositors’
                              willingness to pay to avoid uncertainty to quantify the effects and find that depositors
                              would have had to be offered annualized returns exceeding 50% to prevent withdrawals
                              during high-uncertainty periods.

                                <em>Abstract: </em>We study how the disclosure of corrupt practices affects firms and their employees.  We construct novel firm-level measures of involvement in corrupt practices using randomized audits and public procurement suspensions in Brazil. On average, exposed firms grow larger after the audits. However, this result masks large heterogeneity depending on the degree of firm involvement in the corruption scheme. Using contract-, loan-, and worker- level data, we show that highly corrupt firms suffer after anti-corruption initiatives, while other exposed firms grow by changing their investment strategy when shifting away from doing business with the government.

                                <em>Abstract: </em>The purpose of the paper is to examine the effect of founding family control on the
                                cost of bank debt. We examine the cost of accessing the syndicated market and we use the financial
                                crisis and the unexpected nature of Lehman Brother's collapse as a laboratory in order to tease out
                                the effect of family ownership. We find that the increase in loan spreads around the Lehman crisis
                                was by at least 24 basis points lower for family firms. Furthermore, the gap in spreads among family
                                and non-family firms becomes wider among firms that had pre-crisis relationships with lenders with
                                higher exposure to the shock. The evidence are consistent with family ownership lowering the cost
                                of accessing debt financing especially when lenders are constrained. We further investigate potential
                                channels that drive the effect of family ownership. We provide novel evidence that for 17% of the
                                family firms creditors impose explicit restrictions in private credit agreements that require the
                                founding family to maintain a minimum percentage of ownership or voting power. Thus creditors value
                                the presence of the family. Furthermore, the impact of family control on lowering the cost of bank
                                debt is higher when family CEOs run the firms and among firms with higher ex ante agency conflicts.
