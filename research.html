                    </h5>
                    <p>with Morten Bennedsen and Daniel Wolfenzon</p>
                    <p><strong>Accepted Journal of Financial Economics</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Abstract: </em>We use detailed information on individual absent spells of all employees in 4,140
                        firms in Denmark to document large differences in average absenteeism across firms. Using employees
                        who switch firms, we decompose days absent into an individual component (e.g., motivation, work ethic)
                        and a firm component (e.g., incentives, corporate culture). We find the firm component explains 50%
                        to 60% of the difference in absenteeism across firms, with the individual component explaining the
                        rest. We present suggestive evidence of the mechanisms behind the firm effect with family firm status
                        and concentrated ownership strongly correlated with decreases in absenteeism. We also analyze the
                        firm characteristics that correlate with the individual effect and find that firms with stronger
                        career incentives attract lower-absenteeism employees.</p>

                    <h5>Do Director Election Matter?
                    </h5>
                    <p>with Vyacheslav Fos and Kai Li </p>
                    <p><strong>The Review of Financial Studies</strong>, Volume 31, Issue 4, 1 April 2018, Pages 1499–1531 </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Abstract:</em> Using a hand-collected sample of more than 30,000 directors nominated for election
                        over the period 2001–2010, we construct a novel measure of director proximity to elections— Closeness-to-election.
                        We find that the closer a director is to her next election, the higher is CEO turnover–performance
                        sensitivity. Each year closer to director elections is associated with a 23% increase in CEO turnover–performance
                        sensitivity. Three tests support a causal interpretation of the results. First, when we require directors
                        to have a minimum tenure of three years, there is no material change in the results, suggesting that
                        the timing of when directors join their boards is unlikely to drive the results. Second, we find
                        similar results when we use director Closeness-to-election on other boards as a measure of proximity
                        to elections. Third, when we restrict the analysis to firms with unitary boards, there is no material
                        change in the results, suggesting that director self-selection into firms with staggered boards does
                        not drive the results. Cross-sectional tests suggest that, when other governance mechanisms are in
                        place, CEO turnover–performance sensitivity is affected to a lesser extent by Closeness-to-election.
                        We conclude that director elections have important implications for corporate governance.

                        <em>Abstract: </em>We show that in semiformal economies, banks lend to tax-evading individuals based
                        on the bank's perception of the individual's true income. This observation leads to a novel approach
                        to estimate tax evasion using the adaptation of the private sector to the norms of semiformality.
                        We use bank microdata on household credit, and replicate the bank model of credit capacity decision
                        to infer the bank’s estimate of individuals’ true income. We estimate a lower bound of 28.2 billion
                        euros of unreported income for Greece. The foregone government revenues amount to 32% of the deficit
                        for 2009. Primary tax-evading industries are medicine, law, engineering, education, and media. We
                        provide evidence that tax evasion persists not because the tax authorities are unaware, but because
                        of a lack of paper trail and political willpower. Finally, we speak to the reproducibility and applicability
                        of our method in other semiformal settings.

                    </h5>

                        <em>Abstract: </em>This paper provides causal evidence on the impact of succession taxes on firm investment
                        decisions and transfer of control. I exploit a 2002 policy change in Greece that substantially reduced
                        the tax on intra-family transfers of businesses and show that succession taxes lead to more than
                        a 40% decline in investment around family successions, slow sales growth, and depletion of cash reserves.
                        Furthermore, succession taxes strongly affect the decision to sell or retain the firm within the
                        family. I conclude by discussing implications of my findings for firms in the United States and Europe.

                    </h5>
                    <p>with Vyacheslav Fos</p>
                    <p><strong>Journal of Financial Economics 114 (2014), pp. 316-340</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Abstract: </em>This paper shows that proxy contests have a significant adverse effect on careers
                        of incumbent directors. Following a proxy contest, directors experience a significant decline in
                        number of directorships not only in the targeted company, but also in other non-targeted companies.
                        The results are established using the universe of all proxy contests during 1996-2010. To establish
                        that this effect of proxy contests is causal, we use within-firm variation in directors' exposure
                        to proxy contests and exploit the predetermined schedule of staggered boards that only allows a fraction
                        of directors to be nominated for election every year. We find that nominated directors relative to
                        non-nominated ones lose 45% more seats on other boards. We discuss that this pattern can be expected
                        if proxy contest mechanism imposes a significant career cost on incumbent directors.

                        <em>Abstract: </em>We exploit a 2006 legislation change in Denmark that requires firms to provide gender
                        dis-aggregated wage statistics to study the effect of transparency on gender pay disparities on employee
                        and firm outcomes. Using detailed employee-employer administrative data we find that the policy has
                        an effect in changing compensation within firms, through slowing the growth of compensation for male
                        employees. Furthermore, we find that such changes in firm wage policies following the passage of
                        the law are associated with negative outcomes on overall firm productivity.

                    <p>with Spyridon Lagaras and Jacopo Ponticelli</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Abstract: </em>Corrupt practices in the assignment of government contracts are largely diffused and
                        can generate misallocation of resources across firms. We study how disclosure of such practices affects
                        firm growth and labor reallocation. We exploit exogenous variation in the exposure of corrupt firms
                        using random municipality audits by a large anti-corruption government program in Brazil. Firms exposed
                        by the auditing program experience a decline in employment growth relative to their peers. We document
                        that young, less-educated workers that do not occupy a managerial position have higher probability
                        to leave the exposed firms. Released workers tend to reallocate to smaller firms in the same sector
                        and municipality. Our evidence indicates that the exposure of corrupt practices reduces misallocation
                        of labor.

                    </h5>
                    <p>with Spyridon Lagaras</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Abstract: </em>The purpose of the paper is to examine the effect of founding family control on the
                        cost of bank debt. We examine the cost of accessing the syndicated market and we use the financial
                        crisis and the unexpected nature of Lehman Brother's collapse as a laboratory in order to tease out
                        the effect of family ownership. We find that the increase in loan spreads around the Lehman crisis
                        was by at least 24 basis points lower for family firms. Furthermore, the gap in spreads among family
                        and non-family firms becomes wider among firms that had pre-crisis relationships with lenders with
                        higher exposure to the shock. The evidence are consistent with family ownership lowering the cost
                        of accessing debt financing especially when lenders are constrained. We further investigate potential
                        channels that drive the effect of family ownership. We provide novel evidence that for 17% of the
                        family firms creditors impose explicit restrictions in private credit agreements that require the
                        founding family to maintain a minimum percentage of ownership or voting power. Thus creditors value
                        the presence of the family. Furthermore, the impact of family control on lowering the cost of bank
                        debt is higher when family CEOs run the firms and among firms with higher ex ante agency conflicts.
