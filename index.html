                        </h3>
                        <p>with Elisabeth Kempf (draft available upon request)</p>
                         <em>Abstract: </em>Partisan bias affects the decisions of financial analysts. Using a novel hand-collected dataset that links credit rating analysts to party affiliations from voter records, we show that analysts who do not support the President's party are more likely to downgrade firms. Our identification approach compares analysts with different party affiliations covering the same firm at the same point in time, ensuring that differences in firm fundamentals cannot explain the results. The effect is more pronounced in periods of increased partisan conflict and during election quarters. Overall, our results suggest that partisan bias and political polarization may have adverse effects on the U.S. economy.

                          <em>Abstract: </em>We examine whether pay transparency closes the gender pay gap and affects firm outcomes. The paper exploits a 2006 legislation change in Denmark that requires firms to provide gender dis-aggregated wage statistics. Using detailed employee-employer administrative data we find that the law has an effect in reducing the gender pay gap, primarily through slowing the wage growth for male employees. This effect is more pronounced for firms whose managers have more daughters, presumably due to the effect of daughters on managerial preferences, and for industries with higher gender pay differentials pre-treatment.
 Such changes in firm wage policies following the passage of the law are associated with negative outcomes on overall firm productivity, but also with a reduction in firm wage bill, resulting in no significant effects on firm profitability.
