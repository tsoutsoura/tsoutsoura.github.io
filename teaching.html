                    <h5>Family and Privately Held Firms: Financial and Managerial Perspectives
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Through case studies, lectures, student projects and guest speakers, the course provides students with exposure to the unique
                        finance, governance, and management issues faced by family and privately held firms, and ways in
                        which these issues can be addressed. This elective is designed for students who may be involved in
                        family firms and closely held companies in a variety of roles: joining either their own family's
                        or someone else's firm, and students who will do business with family firms, consult to them, invest
                        in them, work with them in private wealth management, mergers and acquisitions, banking, consulting
                        etc.

                    <h5>Advanced Corporate Finance
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this course is to provide you with an understanding of major decisions made by corporate financial managers
                        and familiarize you with the tools used to make these decisions. The first part of the course covers
                        methods used to value investment projects. Particular attention will be given to the methods of weighted-average
                        cost of capital (WACC), and adjusted present value (APV). The next part of the course focuses on
                        issues of corporate financial structure. The focus will be on the choice of financing through equity,
                        debt and other types of securities and on payout policies through dividends.
